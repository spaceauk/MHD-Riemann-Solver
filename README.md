# MHD-Riemann-solvers (With OpenMP implementation)
Simulate the behaviour of compressible fluid in the presence or absence of magnetic field. Contains features like
1) Positive preserving schemes for density and pressure
2) Constrained transport method to ensure solenoidal magnetic field
3) Compact third-order slope limiter

Types of problem to solve:
1) Shock Tube
2) Rotor problem
3) Blast wave
